## Summary of Lab 11 ##
  In Lab 11 there was only one task that was asked of us to complete and that would count characters, lines and words from a text file. I mostly used the data that was given to us in the last lab and also used the lecture notebook to reference. To begin this lab I took a close look at what had already been given to us in the python file, after I understood what we had been given I began to edit it to properly perform the tasks that were asked. I also noted that after completing this initial section of the lab I needed to assure my code worked properly by running a text file of a poem and a speech of President Obama's. After noticing this I was made sure to download the two text files and assure that they were in the proper file path. 



## Complete Code Used in Lab 11 ##

The code that I edited that had previously been provdided to me for the Lab can be found at this link or inside my Lab 11 repository.

## Conclusion of Lab 11 ##

After completing Lab 11 I thought this lab turned out to be way easier compared to the last lab. I think this is mostly in part due to the previous lecture we had about using AI to help us code. After I knew the basics of what I needed to add to the existing code I put it in the spots where I thought it belonged. After this I ran the code and after recieving errors, I asked the AI that Anaconda provides to make the proper corrections to my code. Once I recieved the feedback from the AI, I copied and pasted it to assure that it did what I was asking of it. Once the corrected code seemed to properly complete the job, I then tested the code on the short PLimerick file that we had previously used in the last lab. After looking through the response that the code was giving my, I manually went into the PLimerick text file and counted the amount of words & lines. After doing so I compared the my values with the values of my code to confirm that the code was correctly displaying what was intended. After this check, I went ahead and ran it on President Obama's speech that we had given to find the word count, line count and number of characters.
